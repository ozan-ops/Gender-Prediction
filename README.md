# Gender Prediction

This Python program predicts gender based on demographic data using machine learning algorithms.

## Description

Gender Prediction is a Python program that utilizes machine learning algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Naive Bayes (NB) to predict gender based on demographic features. The program reads demographic data from a CSV file, preprocesses it by encoding categorical variables and normalizing numerical variables, and then applies machine learning algorithms to make predictions.

## Features

- **Data Processing:** Read demographic data from a CSV file and preprocess it.
- **Machine Learning Models:** Utilize KNN, MLP, and NB algorithms for gender prediction.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
